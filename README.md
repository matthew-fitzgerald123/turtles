# Turtle Recognition Project
machine learning project

I wanted to train a model to recognize sea turtles.

**Development Process:**
1. Gathered a dataset of images of turtles and 'not turtles'. 
2. Performed augmentations to expand the dataset greatly. This ensured a more accurate model with a more expansive, symmetrical dataset.
3. Created a script to train a model on turtle recognition.
4. Debugged and elaborated the model.
5. Created a .python script to observe the model's accuracy (it is very accurate).

**Libraries used:**
PIL, Augmentor, Requests, Tensorflow, Numpy

This model is very, very accurate. Very fun experience!
