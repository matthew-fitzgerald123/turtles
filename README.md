# seaTurtles
I wanted to train a model to recognize sea turtles.

1. Gathered a dataset of images of turtles and 'not turtles'. 

Using a python script I was able to perform image modification operations to expand the dataset. I made use of Wikimedia Commons API to gather my images for free. Then after gathering my images, I performed a check to ensure that each image downloaded was not corrupted. 

I then performed augmentations to expand a dataset from 1000 assets to 10000 assets. This ensured a more accurate model with a more expansive symmetrical dataset.

2. Using a generated tutorial, I was able to create a script to train my model on sea turtle recognition.



3. I then created a script to observe the model's accuracy.
