# seaTurtles
I wanted to train a model to recognize sea turtles.

**Process**
1. Gathered a dataset of images of turtles and 'not turtles'. 

Using a python script I was able to perform image modification operations to expand the dataset. 
I made use of Wikimedia Commons API to gather my images for free. 
Then after gathering my images, I performed a check to ensure that each image downloaded was not corrupted and in a supported file format. 

I then performed augmentations to expand the dataset greatly. This ensured a more accurate model with a more expansive, symmetrical dataset.

2. Using a generated tutorial, I was able to create a script to train a model on turtle recognition.

By using a generated tutorial, I was able to debug and elaborate with more advanced techniques exponentially faster than possible without.

4. I then created a script to observe the model's accuracy, and it is very accurate.

Libraries used:
PIL, Augmentor, Requests, Tensorflow, Numpy

I wanted to make a succesful model, not just a work in progress. This model is very, very accurate. Very fun experience!
